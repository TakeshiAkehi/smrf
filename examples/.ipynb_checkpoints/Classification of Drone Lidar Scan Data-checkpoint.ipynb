Although the point density of scan is quite high (approximately 430 points per square meter), it isn't necessary that SMRF's cellsize corresponds to this value.  A 1 meter grid will often work just as well, and run significantly faster.  A DTM can be generated from the classified output in the next step at whatever resolution is appropriate, and need not be the same as is used here.\n",
