Although the point density of scan is quite high (approximately 430 points per square meter), it isn't necessary that SMRF's cellsize corresponds to this value.  A 1 meter grid will often work just as well, and run significantly faster.  A DTM can be generated from the classified output in the next step at whatever resolution is appropriate, and need not be the same as is used here.\n",

Even large trees don't require a radius setting here that's very large, because the lidar will typically penetrate through the canopy, and the minimum return for that grid cell will often still be ground.\n",
